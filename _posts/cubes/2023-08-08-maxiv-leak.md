 Each module communicates wirelessly. Each module requires a power source with a voltage of 3.7 to 5.2V and draws 1.5 mA of current on average. Each module can support two channels. The detector strip is easy to install and costs 0.5 SEK /meter. The modules have been tested successfully with detector strips over 200 meters in length.
