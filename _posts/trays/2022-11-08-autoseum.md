The Autoseum in Simrishamn (Sweden) has over 200 antique cars climate controlled by a 80kW heat pump. With the current energy crisis, the museum struggled to pay its power bill. A remote interface was built that enabled the heat pump manufacturer to optimize and correct heat pump performance. A switching system was implemented for electric spot price control that **saved the museum up to 8300 €/month on their electricity bill**
